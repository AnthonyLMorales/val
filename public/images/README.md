# Your photos go here

Replace the placeholder URLs in `src/lib/constants.ts` with paths to your 9 photos, e.g.:

- Save your images as `photo-1.jpg` through `photo-9.jpg` in this folder
- In `src/lib/constants.ts`, set `VALENTINE_IMAGES` to:
  `["/images/photo-1.jpg", "/images/photo-2.jpg", ... "/images/photo-9.jpg"]`
